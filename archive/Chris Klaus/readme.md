# Chris Klaus
  I keep rather busy being a solution engineer at Talend and the president / senior data scientist at Drighten Research.  

I've worked as a project manager and application developer within various industries, including government research, online advertising, healthcare, and e-learning.  

I've written proposals to fund research projects and managed budgets and teams to successfully complete funded projects.  I've led teams to support IS and IT services for large user communities.  I find it rewarding to interact with these communities to determine how best to meet their needs.
