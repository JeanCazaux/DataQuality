## <img src='./logo.jpg' width='40' height='40'>Swedish personnummer with accepted foreigners

### Overview
Other Swedish personnummer regexps do not take into account that at Swedish universities, foreigners might get special temporary personnummers with a "P", "T", or "F" instead of the first of the four last numbers.

This code fixes the problem, but does not check the validity of the date, or the last number.
