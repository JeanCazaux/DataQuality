### Overview
Very flexible phone number entry. -- There are many valid ways to enter a phone number, and often there is other data that a restrictive Regex pattern will not abide. -- This pattern accepts any number of letters, commas, pound signs, slashes, spaces, periods, parenthesis, hyphens, plus signs, and asterisks... but amongst it scans for a minimum of 7 digits (modify {7} to adjust the minimum number of required digits (i.e. 10 for area code + phone number, 18 for long international numbers). -- This pattern does not attempt to restrict the entered phone number format in any way, but instead just verfies that enough digits for one was entered. -- Data in excess of the 7 required digits is allowed. -- I've posted another submission that forces compliance for US phone numbers.
